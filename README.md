# Dart Projects: Calculator and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of two main projects in Dart:
1. **Basic Calculator**: A function to perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Algorithms**: Functions for Palindrome checking and sorting algorithms (Quick Sort and Bubble Sort), along with a performance comparison.



## Project Overview

The goal of these projects is to demonstrate:
1. **Basic arithmetic and error handling** using conditional statements.
2. **String manipulation, sorting algorithms, and performance optimization** using Dart.

## Basic Calculator

The **Basic Calculator** function performs operations on two numbers using a specified operator. It includes basic error handling, especially for division by zero. Additionally, it supports multi-step operations, where you can continue using the result of a previous calculation.

## Palindrome Checker

The `isPalindrome` function determines if a given input (string or numeric) is a palindrome. This function:
- Ignores spaces, punctuation, and is case-insensitive.
- Can handle both string and numeric inputs.


## Sorting Algorithms

This section contains two sorting functions, **Quick Sort** and **Bubble Sort**, implemented in Dart. Additionally, a function compares the performance of these algorithms.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of `O(n log n)`. It uses a "divide-and-conquer" approach, dividing the list around a pivot element.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple algorithm with a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, better suited for small datasets. It repeatedly steps through the list, swapping adjacent elements that are in the wrong order.



## Running the Project

To run the project, ensure you have the Dart SDK installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to execute the `main()` function:

   ```bash
   dart run main.dart
   ```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request for any new features or improvements. For major changes, consider opening an issue to discuss what you would like to change.


This README offers a comprehensive overview, function details, usage examples, and error handling for both the Basic Calculator, Algorithms projects, providing users with easy-to-follow instructions  and running the code.
